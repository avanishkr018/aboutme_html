Simply said, 
I design & code.
And... I like good food
I currently tinker around with my Bachelor exploring human centered machine learning and human centric lighting. (Yeah just slap a human centric or centered to anything these days...) 

I am either smiling or looking super serious. If it's the later one, I am probably thinking about food. 

But Avanish, why should we work with you?
Simple answer. The experience of designing products of any scale. Real Products. Real use-cases. Real challenges. Not your dribbble or behance eye-candy designer. 

What's the work I would love to do the most?
This question is particularly hard. As a hybrid designer and developer I enjoy the challenges of analog installations. Especially cybernetics. 

How and where do I work?
I mostly work remotely in 2-hour increments. But I am open for interesting job offers. 

Random fact about me:
I wear black almost exclusively and as I love to tell it's the color of my soul. 

Hit me up!
Always keen to explore new cultures, people, experiences and challenges.
