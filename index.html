Simply said, <br>
I design and code.<br>
And... I like good food<br>
I currently tinker around with my Bachelor exploring human centered machine learning and human centric lighting. (Yeah just slap a human centric or centered to anything these days...) <br><br>

I am either smiling or looking super serious. If it's the later one, I am probably thinking about food. <br>

But Avanish, why should we work with you?<br>
Simple answer. The experience of designing products of any scale. Real Products. Real use-cases. Real challenges. Not your dribbble or behance eye-candy designer. <br>

What's the work I would love to do the most?<br>
This question is particularly hard. As a hybrid designer and developer I enjoy the challenges of analog installations. Especially cybernetics. <br>

How and where do I work?<br>
I mostly work remotely in 2-hour increments. But I am open for interesting job offers. <br>

Random fact about me:<br>
I wear black almost exclusively and as I love to tell it's the color of my soul. <br>

Hit me up!<br>
Always keen to explore new cultures, people, experiences and challenges.<br>
